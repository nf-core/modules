            HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation
            sequencing reads (whole-genome, transcriptome, and exome sequencing data)
            against the general human population (as well as against a single reference genome).
            Based on GCSA (an extension of BWT for a graph) it is designed and implemented as a
            graph FM index (GFM).
