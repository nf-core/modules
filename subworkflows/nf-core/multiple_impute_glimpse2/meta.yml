input:
  - ch_input:
      type: file
      description: |
        Target dataset in CRAM, BAM or VCF/BCF format.
        Index file of the input file.
        File with sample names and ploidy information.
        Structure: [ meta, file, index, txt ]

  - ch_ref:
      type: file
      description: |
        Reference panel of haplotypes in VCF/BCF format.
        Index file of the Reference panel file.
        Target region, usually a full chromosome (e.g. chr20:1000000-2000000 or chr20).
        The file could possibly be without GT field (for efficiency reasons a file containing only the positions is recommended).
        Structure: [ meta, vcf, csi, region ]

  - ch_map:
      type: file
      description: |
        File containing the genetic map.
        Structure: [ meta, gmap ]

  - ch_fasta:
      type: file
      description: |
        Reference genome in fasta format.
        Reference genome index in fai format
        Structure: [ meta, fasta, fai ]

output:
  - chunk_chr:
      type: file
      description: |
        Tab delimited output txt file containing buffer and imputation regions.
        Structure: [meta, txt]

  - merged_variants:
      type: file
      description: |
        Output VCF/BCF file for the merged regions.
        Phased information (HS field) is updated accordingly for the full region.
        Structure: [ val(meta), bcf ]
