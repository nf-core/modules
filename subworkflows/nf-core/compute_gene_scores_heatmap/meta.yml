      description: |
        This subworkflow computes gene scores using methods such as Singscore, GSVA, SSGSEA, PLAGE, and Samsscore and generates a heatmap of gene counts based on annotated data using ComplexHeatmap R package.
        It integrates results into a format suitable for inclusion in MultiQC reports.
input:
  - - normalized_counts:
        type: file
        description: |
          A tab-separated file containing normalized gene expression counts for all genes both Endogenous and Housekeeping genes, depending on the normalization method chosen (genes as rows and samples as columns).
        pattern: "*normalized_counts.tsv"
  - - ch_gene_score_yaml:
        type: file
        description: |
          Optional YAML file to be used for computing the gene scores. Needs both a name for each set of genes and respective genes to be selected.
        pattern: "*.yaml"
  - - annotated_endo_data:
        type: file
        description: |
          A tab-separated file containing  normalized expression counts for the Endogenous genes (genes as columns and samples as rows).
        pattern: "*.tsv"
  - - ch_heatmap_genes_to_filter:
        type: file
        description: |
          Path to YAML file (list, one item per line) to specify which genes should be used for the gene-count heatmap.
        pattern: "*.yaml"
output:
  - multiqc_files:
      - "*.txt":
          type: file
          description: |
            Files containing calculated gene scores for inclusion in MultiQC reports.
          pattern: "*.txt"
      - "*gene_heatmap_mqc.png":
          type: file
          description: |
            A PNG image of the gene heatmap, formatted for inclusion in MultiQC reports.
