        Groovy Map containing sample information
        e.g. [ id:'string' ]
  - normalized_counts:
      type: file
      description: |
        A tab-separated file containing normalized gene expression counts for all genes both Endogenous and Housekeeping genes, depending on the normalization method chosen (genes as rows and samples as columns).

      type: file
      description: |
        Optional YAML file to be used for computing the gene scores. Needs both a name for each set of genes and respective genes to be selected.

      type: file
      description: |
        A tab-separated file containing  normalized expression counts for the Endogenous genes (genes as columns and samples as rows).

  - ch_heatmap_genes_to_filter:
      type: file
      description: |
        Path to YAML file (list, one item per line) to specify which genes should be used for the gene-count heatmap.
      pattern: "*.yaml"
