name: "faa_seqfu_seqkit"
description: |
  Subworkflow that optionally preprocesses amino acid FASTA sequences
  (seqkit seq/replace/rmdup), computes sequence statistics before and
  after preprocessing using seqfu stats, and exports MultiQC-compatible
  statistics and software versions.
keywords:
  - fasta
  - protein
  - preprocessing
  - statistics
  - quality check
components:
  - seqfu/stats
  - seqkit/seq
  - seqkit/rmdup
  - seqkit/replace
input:
  - ch_fasta:
      type: file
      description: |
        Amino acid sequences fasta file.
        Structure: [ val(meta), [ path(fasta) ] ]
  - skip_preprocessing:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If true, skip seqkit-based preprocessing steps and only compute
        initial sequence statistics.
output:
  - fasta:
      type: file
      description: |
        Contains the final amino acid FASTA file
        (either preprocessed or original if preprocessing is skipped).
  - multiqc_files:
      type: file
      description: |
        Statistics file for MultiQC.
  - versions:
      type: file
      description: |
        Versions file containing the software versions used in the workflow.
