        Channel with the input data for functional analysis.
        Note that the input file can be the results from differential abundance analysis,
        or normalized abundance.

  - ch_gene_sets:
      description: |
        Channel with the gene sets file.
        If only gprofiler2 is required to run, and no gene sets file is available,
        one can provide this as a empty `Channel.of([[], []])`, then gprofiler2 will 
        automatically parse a gene sets database based on organism/token information.

        Channel with the file specifying the background genes.
        This is only needed to run gprofiler2. If not, a empty `Channel.of([[], []])`
        can be provided instead.
