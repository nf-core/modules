  - ch_reads:
      type: file
      description: |
        List of FastQ files of size 1 and 2 for single-end and paired-end data, respectively.
        Structure: [ val(meta), [ path(reads) ] ]
  - skip_trimmomatic:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If true, skips the trimmomatic process.
  - skip_cutadapt:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If true, skips the cutadapt process.
  - skip_trimgalore:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If true, skips the trimgalore process.
        We suggest running either cutadapt or trimgalore,
        because trimgalore also runs cutadapt in the background.
  - skip_bbduk:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If true, skips the bbmap/bbduk process.
  - contaminants:
      type: file
      description: |
        Reference files used by bbmap/bbduk and/or fastp, containing adapter and/or contaminant sequences for removal
  - skip_fastp:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If true, skips the fastp process.
  - fastp_discard_trimmed_pass:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Specify true to not write any reads that pass trimming thresholds from the fastp process.
        This can be used to use fastp for the output report only.
  - fastp_save_trimmed_fail:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Specify true to save files that failed to pass fastp trimming thresholds
        ending in `*.fail.fastq.gz`
  - save_merged:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Specify true to save all merged reads to a file ending in `*.merged.fastq.gz`
        Used by fastp
