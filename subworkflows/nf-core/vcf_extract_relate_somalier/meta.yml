input:
  - ch_vcfs:
      description: |
        The input VCFs to perform the stats on, optionally with their indices.
        This channel can also contain the number of samples in the same family/group
        to check relatedness. This is advised to add as it can improve the efficiency of your pipeline
        Structure: [ val(meta), path(vcf), path(tbi), val(count) ]
  - ch_fasta:
      description: |
        The reference FASTA used to create the VCF files
        Structure: [ path(fasta) ]
  - ch_fasta_fai:
      description: |
        The index of the reference FASTA
        Structure: [ path(fasta_fai) ]
  - ch_somalier_sites:
      description: |
        A VCF containing the common sites for Somalier
        Structure: [ path(somalier_sites_vcf) ]
  - ch_peds:
      description: |
        A channel containing an optional PED file for the corresponding families. This channel has to be given, but can be like `[meta, []]`.
        When you don't want to use a PED file, you must supply a channel
        containing the meta and an empty value (`[]`) instead of a PED
        Structure: [ val(meta), path(ped) ]
  - ch_sample_groups:
      description: |
        Optional - A text file describing how the samples should be grouped
        Structure: [ path(txt) ]
  - val_common_id:
      description: |
        Optional - A common identifier in the meta map.
        This will be used to determine which VCFs should be used in somalier_relate.
        This value should be given when using single sample VCFs
output:
  - extract:
      description: |
        The extract file created with Somalier extract
        Structure: [ val(meta), path(extract) ]
  - html:
      description: |
        An HTML file containing an interactive graph on the relatedness of the samples
        Structure: [ val(meta), path(html) ]
  - pairs_tsv:
      description: |
        A TSV file detailing the relatedness between pairs of samples
        Structure: [ val(meta), path(tsv) ]
  - samples_tsv:
      description: |
        A TSV file detailing the relatedness between all samples with the same meta
        Structure: [ val(meta), path(tsv) ]
  - versions:
      description: |
        Files containing software versions
