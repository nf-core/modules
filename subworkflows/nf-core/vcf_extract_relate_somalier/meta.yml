      description: |
        The input VCFs to perform the stats on, optionally with their indices.
        This channel can also contain the number of samples in the same family/group
        to check relatedness. This is advised to add as it can improve the efficiency of your pipeline

      description: |
        A channel containing an optional PED file for the corresponding families. This channel has to be given, but can be like `[meta, []]`.
        When you don't want to use a PED file, you must supply a channel
        containing the meta and an empty value (`[]`) instead of a PED
