      description: |
        Structure: [ val(meta), path (reads) ]
        Groovy Map containing sample information
        e.g. [ id:'test', single_end:false ], List of input FastQ files of size 1 and 2 for single-end and paired-end data,
        respectively. If you wish to run interleaved paired-end data,  supply as single-end data
        but with `--interleaved_in` in your `modules.conf`'s `ext.args` for the module.

      description: |
        Structure: val(save_merged)
        Specify true to save all merged reads to the a file ending in `*.merged.fastq.gz`
