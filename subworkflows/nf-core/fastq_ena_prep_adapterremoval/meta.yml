        Structure: [ val(meta), path(fastq), val(phred_plus) ]
        One or two FASTQ files for single or paired end data respectively.
        `phred_plus` specifies the `--qualitybase` option of AdapterRemoval
        for the respective FastQ files. Should be one of: [ `33`, `64` ].
        If the meta already contains an attribute named `phred`, it will
        be overwritten with the `phred_plus` value.

      type: file
      description: Optional text file containing list of adapters to look for for removal
        with one adapter per line. Otherwise will look for default adapters (see
        AdapterRemoval man page), or can be modified to remove user-specified
        adapters via ext.args.
