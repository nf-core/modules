        The input channel of this subworkflow containing:
        - meta: Groovy Map containing sample information => doesn't have a field called 'genomic_region'
        - bam: BAM/CRAM/SAM file
        - bai: Index for BAM/CRAM/SAM file
        - regions_file: A file containing the genomic regions used to separate the reads in the
            input bam. This should be a BED or TSV file containing either a single
            column of chromosome names, two columns (chromosome name and position),
            or three columns (chromosome name, start position, and end position).
        Structure: [ val(meta), path(bam), path(bai), path(regions_file) ]
output:
  - bam_bai:
      description: |
        BAM/CRAM/SAM file, the meta contains a new 'genomic_region' field with the included regions
