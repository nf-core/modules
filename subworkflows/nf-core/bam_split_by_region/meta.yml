        A file containing the genomic regions used to separate the reads in the
        input bam. This should be a BED or TSV file containing either a single
        column of chromosome names, two columns (chromosome name and position),
        or three columns (chromosome name, start position, and end position).

        This will include an additional entry 'genomic_region' that contains the
        chromosome name that the included reads are mapped to.
