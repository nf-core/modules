        Groovy Map containing sample information

      description: |
        Target dataset in VCF/BCF format defined at all variable positions.
        Index file of the input VCF/BCF file containing genotype likelihoods.
        Pedigree information in the following format: offspring father mother.
        Target region, usually a full chromosome (e.g. chr20:1000000-2000000 or chr20).
        The file could possibly be without GT field (for efficiency reasons a file containing only the positions is recommended).
