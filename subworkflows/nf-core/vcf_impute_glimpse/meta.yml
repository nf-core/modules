      description: |
        Target dataset in VCF/BCF format defined at all variable positions.
        Index file of the input VCF/BCF file containing genotype likelihoods.
        File with sample names and ploidy information.
        Target region, usually a full chromosome (e.g. chr20:1000000-2000000 or chr20).
        Reference panel of haplotypes in VCF/BCF format.
        Index file of the Reference panel file.
        File containing the genetic map.
        The file could possibly be without GT field (for efficiency reasons a file containing only the positions is recommended).
