      description: |
        Target dataset in VCF/BCF format defined at all variable positions.
        Index file of the input VCF/BCF file containing genotype likelihoods.
        Target region, usually a full chromosome (e.g. chr20:1000000-2000000 or chr20).
        The file could possibly be without GT field (for efficiency reasons a file containing only the positions is recommended).
        Structure: [ meta, vcf, csi, region ]

  - ch_ref:
      type: file
      description: |
        Reference panel of haplotypes in VCF/BCF format.
        Index file of the Reference panel file.
        Structure: [ meta, vcf, csi ]

  - ch_infos:
      type: file
      description: |
        File with sample names and ploidy information.
        One sample per line with a mandatory second column indicating ploidy (1 or 2).
        Sample names that are not present are assumed to have ploidy 2 (diploids).
        GLIMPSE does NOT handle the use of sex (M/F) instead of ploidy.

  - phased_variants:
      type: file
      description: |
        Output VCF/BCF file containing genotype probabilities (GP field),
        imputed dosages (DS field), best guess genotypes (GT field),
        sampled haplotypes in the last (max 16) main iterations (HS field) and info-score.
        Structure: [ val(meta), bcf ]

  - merged_variants:
      type: file
      description: |
        Output VCF/BCF file for the merged regions.
        Phased information (HS field) is updated accordingly for the full region.
