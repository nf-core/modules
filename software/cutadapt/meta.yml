            Cutadapt finds and removes adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails and other types of unwanted sequence
            from your high-throughput sequencing reads.

            Cleaning your data in this way is often required: Reads from small-RNA sequencing contain the 3’
            sequencing adapter because the read is longer than the molecule that is sequenced. Amplicon reads
            start with a primer sequence. Poly-A tails are useful for pulling out RNA from your sample, but
            often you don’t want them to be in your reads.
