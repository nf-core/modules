name: gubbins
description: Gubbins (Genealogies Unbiased By recomBinations In Nucleotide Sequences) is an algorithm that iteratively identifies
            loci containing elevated densities of base substitutions while concurrently constructing a phylogeny based on the
            putative point mutations outside of these regions.
