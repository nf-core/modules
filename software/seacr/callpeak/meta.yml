        description: |
            SEACR is intended to call peaks and enriched regions from sparse CUT&RUN
             or chromatin profiling data in which background is dominated by "zeroes"
             (i.e. regions with no read coverage).

params:
    - outdir:
        type: string
        description: |
            The pipeline's output directory. By default, the module will
            output files into `$params.outdir/<SOFTWARE>`
    - publish_dir_mode:
        type: string
        description: |
            Value for the Nextflow `publishDir` mode parameter.
            Available: symlink, rellink, link, copy, copyNoFollow, move.
    - enable_conda:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            Run the module with Conda using the software specified
            via the `conda` directive
    - singularity_pull_docker_container:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            Instead of directly downloading Singularity images for use with Singularity,
            force the workflow to pull and convert Docker containers instead.
