      description: |
        A read structure should always be provided for each of the fastq files.
        If single end, the string will contain only one structure (i.e. "2M11S+T"), if paired-end the string
        will contain two structures separated by a blank space (i.e. "2M11S+T 2M11S+T").
        If the read does not contain any UMI, the structure will be +T (i.e. only template of any length).
