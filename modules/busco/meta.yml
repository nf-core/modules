        It can be a dataset name, i.e. bacteria_odb10, or a path i.e. ./bacteria_odb10 or /home/user/bacteria_odb10.
        In the former case, which is the recommended usage, BUSCO will automatically download and version the corresponding dataset.
        You can get the list of possible datasets by running "busco --list-datasets" see "www.busco.ezlab.org/list_of_lineages.html" and "www.busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#lineage-datasets".
