        Either a nucleotide fasta file or a protein fasta file, depending on the BUSCO mode.
        As of v5.1.0 the input argument can now also be a directory containing fasta files to run in batch mode.
      pattern: "*.fasta" #How do I handle passing a directory to this?

      type: string
      description: Sets the assessment MODE as genome, proteins, transcriptome.
  - output_dir:
      type: string
      description: defines the folder that will contain all results, logs, and intermediate data.

        It can be a dataset name, i.e. bacteria_odb10, or a path i.e. ./bacteria_odb10 or /home/user/bacteria_odb10.
        In the former case, which is the recommended usage, BUSCO will automatically download and version the corresponding dataset.
        You can get the list of possible datasets by running "busco --list-datasets" see "https://busco.ezlab.org/list_of_lineages.html".
