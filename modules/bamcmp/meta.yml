      description:
        Bamcmp is a tool for deconvolving host and graft reads, using two bam files. Reads should be mapped to two genomes, and the mapped,
        sorted bam files supplied to the tool. It is highly recommended to use the "-s as" option not the "-s mapq" option, else
        reads which multimap to the contamination genome will be spuriously kept.
