description: |
  Build a recalibration model to score variant quality for filtering purposes.
  It is highly recommended to follow GATK best practices when using this module,
  the gaussian mixture model requires a large number of samples to be used for the
  tool to produce optimal results. For example, 30 samples for exome data. For more details see

        Developed in the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute, the toolkit offers a wide variety of tools
        with a primary focus on variant discovery and genotyping. Its powerful processing engine
        and high-performance computing features make it capable of taking on projects of any size.
