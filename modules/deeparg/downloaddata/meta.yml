      Some empty or dummy file. This is required to 'trick' the singularity
      container to read a certain file that has incorrect permissions (requires
      root), which is required for loading of an ancient dependency included in
      the container. For nf-core pipelines, we suggest using simple passing
      file("$projectDir/assets/multiqc_config.yaml) as the input channel for
      this input. Otherwise an empty list is sufficient here as this is only
      used when singularity is used.
