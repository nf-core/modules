        "The Foreign Contamination Screening (FCS) tool rapidly detects contaminants from foreign
        organisms in genome assemblies to prepare your data for submission. Therefore, the
        submission process to NCBI is faster and fewer contaminated genomes are submitted.
        This reduces errors in analyses and conclusions, not just for the original data submitter
        but for all subsequent users of the assembly."
