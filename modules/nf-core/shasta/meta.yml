description: The goal of the Shasta long read assembler is to rapidly produce accurate assembled sequence using DNA reads generated by Oxford Nanopore flow cells as input. Please note Assembler is design to focus on speed, so assembly may be considered somewhat non-deterministic as final assembly may vary across executions. See https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta/issues/296.
