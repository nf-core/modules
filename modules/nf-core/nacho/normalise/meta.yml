  NACHO (NAnostring quality Control dasHbOard) is developed for NanoString nCounter data.
  NanoString nCounter data is a messenger-RNA/micro-RNA (mRNA/miRNA) expression assay and works with fluorescent barcodes.
  Each barcode is assigned a mRNA/miRNA, which can be counted after bonding with its target.
  As a result each count of a specific barcode represents the presence of its target mRNA/miRNA.

      description: |
        R package that uses two main functions to summarize and visualize NanoString RCC files,
        namely: `load_rcc()` and `visualise()`. It also includes a function `normalise()`, which (re)calculates
        sample specific size factors and normalises the data.
