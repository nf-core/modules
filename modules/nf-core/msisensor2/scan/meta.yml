      description: "MSIsensor2 is a novel algorithm based machine learning, featuring a large upgrade in the microsatellite instability (MSI) detection for tumor only sequencing data, including Cell-Free DNA (cfDNA), Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded(FFPE) and other sample types. The original MSIsensor is specially designed for tumor/normal paired sequencing data."
