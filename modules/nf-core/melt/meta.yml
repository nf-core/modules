      description: MELT requires transposon .zip files to direct MEI discovery. Such files are included within the MELT tar-ball for the 1KGP versions of Hg19 and Hg38, and are located in the me_refs folder after extraction. The provided .zip files listed above do not require further modification in order to be used for MEI discovery.
