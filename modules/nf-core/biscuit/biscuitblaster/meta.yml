  - samblaster:
      description: |
        samblaster is a fast and flexible program for marking duplicates in read-id grouped paired-end SAM files.
        It can also optionally output discordant read pairs and/or split read mappings to separate SAM files,
        and/or unmapped/clipped reads to a separate FASTQ file.
        By default, samblaster reads SAM input from stdin and writes SAM to stdout.

        SAMtools is a set of utilities for interacting with and post-processing
        short DNA sequence read alignments in the SAM, BAM and CRAM formats, written by Heng Li.
        These files are generated as output by short read aligners like BWA.
