          Groovy Map containing run and contrast information. This can be used at the
          workflow level to pass optional parameters to the module, e.g.
          [
            contrast_id: 'treatment_mCherry_hND6',
            contrast_variable: 'treatment',

            blocking_factors: 'sample_number'
          ]
          Plus mandatory `id` and other fields created along the run.
