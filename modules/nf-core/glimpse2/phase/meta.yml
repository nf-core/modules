      type: file
      description: |
        Either multiple BAM/CRAM files containing low-coverage sequencing reads or one VCF/BCF file containing the genotype likelihoods.
        When using BAM/CRAM the name of the file is used as samples name.
      pattern: "*.{bam,cram,vcf,vcf.gz,bcf,bcf.gz}"

  - input_index:
      type: file
      description: Index file of the input BAM/CRAM/VCF/BCF file.
      pattern: "*.{bam.bai,cram.crai,vcf.gz.csi,bcf.gz.csi}"

  - samples_file:
      type: file
      description: |
        File with sample names and ploidy information.
        One sample per line with a mandatory second column indicating ploidy (1 or 2).
        Sample names that are not present are assumed to have ploidy 2 (diploids).
        GLIMPSE does NOT handle the use of sex (M/F) instead of ploidy.

  - input_region:
      type: string
      description: |
        Target region used for imputation, including left and right buffers (e.g. chr20:1000000-2000000).
        Optional if reference panel is in bin format.
      pattern: "chrXX:leftBufferPosition-rightBufferPosition"

      description: |
        File containing the genetic map.
