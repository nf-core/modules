  - meta:
      type: map
      description: |
        Groovy Map containing sample information
        e.g. [ id:'test', single_end:false ]

  - input:
      type: file
      description: |
        Target dataset in VCF/BCF format defined at all variable positions.
        The file could possibly be without GT field (for efficiency reasons a file containing only the positions is recommended).
      pattern: "*.{vcf,bcf,vcf.gz,bcf.gz}"

  - input_index:
      type: file
      description: Index file of the input VCF/BCF file containing genotype likelihoods.
      pattern: "*.{vcf.gz.csi,bcf.gz.csi}"

  - region:
      type: string
      description: |
        Target region, usually a full chromosome (e.g. chr20:1000000-2000000 or chr20).
        For chrX, please treat PAR and non-PAR regions as different choromosome in order to avoid mixing ploidy.

  - map:
      type: file
      description: File containing the genetic map.
      pattern: "*.gmap"

  - model:
      type: string
      description: |
        Algorithm model to use:
        "recursive": Recursive algorithm
        "sequential": Sequential algorithm (Recommended)
        "uniform-number-variants": Experimental. Uniform the number of variants in the sequential algorithm
      pattern: "{recursive,sequential,uniform-number-variants}"
