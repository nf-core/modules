        Full count matrix as an h5 file, with background RNA removed. This file contains only the droplet barcodes which were determined to have a > 50% posterior probability of containing cells.

        The full posterior probability of noise counts. This is not normally used downstream.

        CSV file containing all the droplet barcodes which were determined to have a > 50% posterior probability of containing cells. |
        Barcodes are written in plain text. This information is also contained in each of the above outputs, |
        but is included as a separate output for convenient use in certain downstream applications.
