      description: "IslandPath-DIMOB is a standalone software to predict genomic islands in bacterial and archaeal genomes based on the presence of dinucleotide biases and mobility genes.

Genomic islands (GIs) are clusters of genes in prokaryotic genomes of probable horizontal origin. GIs are disproportionately associated with microbial adaptations of medical or environmental interest."
