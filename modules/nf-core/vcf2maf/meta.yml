        "Convert a VCF into a MAF where each variant is annotated to only one of all possible gene isoforms using vcf2maf. vcf2maf is designed to work with VEP, so it is recommended to have VEP and vcf2maf installed when running this module. Running VEP requires a VEP cache to be present. It is recommended to set the --species and --ncbi-build in ext.args (use the module config). If you wish to skip VEP, add `--inhibit-vep` to ext.args. It may also be necessary to set --tumor-id and --normal-id for correct parsing of the VCF."
