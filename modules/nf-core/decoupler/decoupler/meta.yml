description: |
  decoupler is a package containing different statistical methods
  to extract biological activities from omics data within a unified framework.
  It allows to flexibly test any enrichment method with any prior knowledge
  resource and incorporates methods that take into account the sign and weight.
  It can be used with any omic, as long as its features can be linked to a
  biological process based on prior knowledge. For example, in transcriptomics
  gene sets regulated by a transcription factor, or in phospho-proteomics
  phosphosites that are targeted by a kinase.
