description: The script reads a gff annotation file, and create two output files,
  one contains the gene models with ORF passing the test, the other contains the rest.
  By default the test is "> 100" that means all gene models that have ORF longer than
  100 Amino acids, will pass the test.

          Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any,
          otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config --expose".
          The --config option gives you the possibility to use your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named differently).
