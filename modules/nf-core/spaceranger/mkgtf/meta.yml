        Visium Spatial Gene Expression is a next-generation molecular profiling solution for classifying tissue
        based on total mRNA. Space Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines that process Visium Spatial Gene Expression
        data with brightfield and fluorescence microscope images. Space Ranger allows users to map the whole
        transcriptome in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) and fresh frozen tissues to discover novel
        insights into normal development, disease pathology, and clinical translational research. Space Ranger provides
        pipelines for end to end analysis of Visium Spatial Gene Expression experiments.
