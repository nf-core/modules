        Target dataset in VCF/BCF format defined at all variable positions.
        The file could possibly be without GT field (for efficiency reasons a file containing only the positions is recommended).

      type: string
      description: |
        Target region, usually a full chromosome (e.g. chr20:1000000-2000000 or chr20).
        For chrX, please treat PAR and non-PAR regions as different choromosome in order to avoid mixing ploidy.
