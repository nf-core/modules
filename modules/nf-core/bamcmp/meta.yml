description: Bamcmp (Bam Compare) is a tool for assigning reads between a primary
  genome and a contamination genome. For instance, filtering out mouse reads from
  patient derived xenograft mouse models (PDX).

      description: Bamcmp is a tool for deconvolving host and graft reads, using two
        bam files. Reads should be mapped to two genomes, and the mapped, sorted bam
        files supplied to the tool. It is highly recommended to use the "-s as" option
        not the "-s mapq" option, else reads which multimap to the contamination genome
        will be spuriously kept.
