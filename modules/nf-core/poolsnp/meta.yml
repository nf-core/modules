          Maximum coverage is calculated for every library and chromosomal arm
          as the percentile of a coverage distribution,
          e.g. max-cov=0.98 will only consider positions within the 98% coverage percentile
          for a given sample and chromosomal arm.
          Note: Provide `max_cov` or `max_cov_file` but not both.

        type: file
        description: |
          File containing the maximum coverage thresholds for all chromosomal arms and libraries.
          This file needs to be tab-delimited with two columns:
          1. Chromosomal name
          2. Comma-separated list of coverage thresholds for each sample in the mpileup file.
          e.g. `2L 100,100,100,200,200` would mean a threshold of 100 for the first three samples
          and 200 for the last two samples on chromosomal arm 2L.
          Note: Provide `max_cov` or `max_cov_file` but not both.
