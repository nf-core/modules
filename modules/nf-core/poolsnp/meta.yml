input:

      type: map
      description: |
        Groovy Map containing sample information.
        e.g. `[ id:'sample1', single_end:false ]`

  - mpileup:
      type: file
      description: |
        MPILEUP file. This file contains the base calls and alignment information
        for each position in the reference genome.
        It is used as input for variant calling and other downstream analyses.
      pattern: "*.mpileup"

      type: map
      description: |
        Groovy Map containing sample information.

  - max_cov:
      type: float
      description: |
        Maximum coverage is calculated for every library and chromosomal arm
        as the percentile of a coverage distribution,
        e.g. max-cov=0.98 will only consider positions within the 98% coverage percentile
        for a given sample and chromosomal arm.
        Note: Provide `max_cov` or `max_cov_file` but not both.

  - max_cov_file:
      type: file
      description: |
        File containing the maximum coverage thresholds for all chromosomal arms and libraries.
        This file needs to be tab-delimited with two columns:
        1. Chromosomal name
        2. Comma-separated list of coverage thresholds for each sample in the mpileup file.
        e.g. `2L 100,100,100,200,200` would mean a threshold of 100 for the first three samples
        and 200 for the last two samples on chromosomal arm 2L.
        Note: Provide `max_cov` or `max_cov_file` but not both.
