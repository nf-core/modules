description: Ilastik is a tool that utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify
  pixels, segment, track and count cells in images. Ilastik contains a graphical user
  interface to interactively label pixels. However, this nextflow module will implement
  the --headless mode, to apply pixel classification using a pre-trained .ilp file
  on an input image.
