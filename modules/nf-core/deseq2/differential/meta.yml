        Groovy Map containing contrast information. This can be used at the
        workflow level to pass optional parameters to the module, e.g.
        [ id:'contrast1', blocking:'patient' ] passed in as ext.args like:
        '--blocking_variable $meta.blocking'.

      description: |
        Optional file of transcript lengths, with the same sample columns as
        counts. If supplied, lengths will be supplied to DESeq2 to correct for
        differences in average transcript lengths across samples.
