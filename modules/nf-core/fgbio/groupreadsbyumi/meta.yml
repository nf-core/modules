  Groups reads together that appear to have come from the same original molecule.
  Reads are grouped by template, and then templates are sorted by the 5’ mapping positions
  of the reads from the template, used from earliest mapping position to latest.
  Reads that have the same end positions are then sub-grouped by UMI sequence.
  (!) Note: the MQ tag is required on reads with mapped mates (!)
  This can be added using samblaster with the optional argument --addMateTags.
