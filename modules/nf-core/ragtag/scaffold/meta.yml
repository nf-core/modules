  Scaffolding is the process of ordering and orienting draft assembly (query)
  sequences into longer sequences. Gaps (stretches of "N" characters) are placed
  between adjacent query sequences to indicate the presence of unknown sequence.
  RagTag uses whole-genome alignments to a reference assembly to scaffold query sequences.
  RagTag does not alter input query sequence in any way and only orders and orients sequences, joining them with gaps.
