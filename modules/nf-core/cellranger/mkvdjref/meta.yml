      description: Cell Ranger processes data from 10X Genomics Chromium kits. `cellranger
        vdj` takes FASTQ files from `cellranger mkfastq` or `bcl2fastq` for V(D)J libraries
        and performs sequence assembly and paired clonotype calling. It uses the Chromium
        cellular barcodes and UMIs to assemble V(D)J transcripts per cell. Clonotypes
        and CDR3 sequences are output as a `.vloupe` file which can be loaded into Loupe
        V(D)J Browser.
