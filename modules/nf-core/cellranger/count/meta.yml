      description: Cell Ranger by 10x Genomics is a set of analysis pipelines that process
        Chromium single-cell data to align reads, generate feature-barcode matrices,
        perform clustering and other secondary analysis, and more.

          List of input FastQ files. The order of the input files MUST be ["sample1 R1", "sample1 R2", "sample2, R1",
          "sample2, R2", ...]. This can usually be achieved by sorting the input files by file name.

          Background: 10x data is always paired-end with R1 containing cell barcode and UMI
          and R2 containing the actual read sequence. Cell Ranger requires files to adhere to the following file-name
          convention: `${Sample_Name}_S1_L00${Lane_Number}_${R1,R2}_001.fastq.gz`. This module automatically
          renames files to match this convention based on the order of input files to avoid various
          issues (see https://github.com/nf-core/scrnaseq/issues/241). To avoid mistakes, the module
          throws an error if a pair of R1 and R2 fastq files does not have the same filename except for the "_R1"/"_R2" part.
          Renaming the files does not affect the results (see README.md for detailed tests).
        pattern: "*{R1,R2}*.fastq.gz"
