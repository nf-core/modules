      description: "TINC is a package that implements algorithms to determine the contamination
        of a bulk sequencing sample in the context of cancer studies (matched tumour/
        normal). The contamination estimated by TINC can be either due to normal cells
        sampled in the tumour biopsy or to tumour cells in the normal biopsy. The former
        case is traditionally called purity, or cellularity, and a number of tools exist
        to estimate it. The latter case is less common, and that is the main reason
        TINC has been developed. For this reason, the package takes name TINC, Tumour-in-Normal
        contamination. TINC is part of the evoverse, a package that gathers multiple
        R packages to implement Cancer Evolution analyses."
