          description: This file uses bed12 format to show the transcript model for each
            read based on the mapping prior to collapsing. This only contains the reads
            which were accepted according to the defined thresholds. You can use this
            file to see if there were any strange occurrences during collapsing. It also
            contains the relationships between reads and collapsed transcript models.
            The 1st subfield in the 4th column shows the final transcript ID and the 2nd
            subfield in the 4th column shows the read ID. If you used no_cap mode for
            collapsing there may be multiple lines for a single read. This happens when
            a 5' degraded read can match to multiple 5' longer transcript models.
