      description: RapidNJ is an algorithmic engineered implementation of canonical
        neighbour-joining. It uses an efficient search heuristic to speed-up the core
        computations of the neighbour-joining method that enables RapidNJ to outperform
        other state-of-the-art neighbour-joining implementations.
