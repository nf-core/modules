        anndata is a Python library specifically designed for handling |
        and managing large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) |
        data. Itâ€™s part of the Scanpy ecosystem and is widely used in |
        single-cell bioinformatics workflows.

          CSV file containing all the droplet barcodes which were determined to have a > 50% posterior probability of containing cells. |
          Barcodes are written in plain text. This information is also contained in each of the above outputs, |
          but is included as a separate output for convenient use in certain downstream applications.
