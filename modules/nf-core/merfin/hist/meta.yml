      description: "Merfin (k-mer based finishing tool) is a suite of subtools to variant filtering, assembly evaluation and polishing via k-mer validation. The subtool -hist estimates the QV (quality value of [Merqury](https://github.com/marbl/merqury)) for each scaffold/contig and genome-wide averages. In addition, Merfin produces a QV* estimate, which accounts also for kmers that are seen in excess with respect to their expected multiplicity predicted from the reads."
