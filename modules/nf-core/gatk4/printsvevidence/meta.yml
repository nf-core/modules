description: WARNING - this tool is still experimental and shouldn't be used in a
  production setting. Gathers paired-end and split read evidence files for use in
  the GATK-SV pipeline. Output files are a file containing the location of and orientation
  of read pairs marked as discordant, and a file containing the clipping location
  of all soft clipped reads and the orientation of the clipping.

        Developed in the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute, the toolkit offers a wide variety of tools
        with a primary focus on variant discovery and genotyping. Its powerful processing engine
        and high-performance computing features make it capable of taking on projects of any size.
