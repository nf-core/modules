name: "gatk4_svannotate"
description: Adds predicted functional consequence, gene overlap, and noncoding element overlap annotations to SV VCF from GATK-SV pipeline. Input files are an SV VCF, a GTF file containing primary or canonical transcripts, and a BED file containing noncoding elements. Output file is an annotated SV VCF.
