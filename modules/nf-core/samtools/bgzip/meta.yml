        The file command is "a file type guesser", that is, a command-line tool that tells you
        in words what kind of data a file contains. Unlike most GUI systems, command-line UNIX
        systems - with this program leading the charge - don't rely on filename extentions to
        tell you the type of a file, but look at the file's actual contents. This is, of course,
        more reliable, but requires a bit of I/O.
