      description: "ART is a set of simulation tools to generate synthetic next-generation
        sequencing reads. ART simulates sequencing reads by mimicking real sequencing
        process with empirical error models or quality profiles summarized from large
        recalibrated sequencing data. ART can also simulate reads using user own read
        error model or quality profiles. "
