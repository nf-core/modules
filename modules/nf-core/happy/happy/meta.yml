description: Hap.py is a tool to compare diploid genotypes at haplotype level. Rather than comparing VCF records row by row, hap.py will generate and match alternate sequences in a superlocus. A superlocus is a small region of the genome (sized between 1 and around 1000 bp) that contains one or more variants.
