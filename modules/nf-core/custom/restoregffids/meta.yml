name: "custom_restoregffids"
description: |
  Restores sequence IDs in a gff3 file based on a TSV table consisting of original (first column) and new IDs (second column). The input gff file is expected to have the new IDs (first column). The output gff file is restored with original IDs (second column). This module is helpful when some tools like EDTA implicitly shorten the IDs without producing an ID map, leading to downstream mismatch in IDs across files.
