input:
  - meta:
      type: map
      description: |
        Groovy Map containing information on matrix to be filtered, at a
        minimum an id. e.g. [ id:'test' ]
  - abundance:
      type: file
      description: |
        Raw TSV or CSV format abundance matrix with features (e.g.
        genes) by row and observations (e.g. samples) by column. All rownames
        from the sample sheet should be present in the columns.
  - samplesheet_meta:
      type: map
      description: |
        Where samplesheet is provided, aroovy Map containing information on
        sample sheet, at a minimum an id.  e.g. [ id:'test' ]
  - samplesheet:
      type: file
      description: |
        Optional CSV or TSV format sample sheet with sample metadata. If
        provided this is used to infer minimum passing samples from group sizes
        present (see grouping_variable), but also to validate matrix columns.
        If not provided, all numeric columns are selected.
  - minimum_abundance:
      type: numeric
      description: |
        Minimum abundance value, supplied via task.ext.args as --minimum_abundance
      default: 1
  - minimum_samples:
      type: numeric
      description: |
        Minimum observations that must pass the threshold to retain
        the row/ feature (e.g. gene). Supplied via task.ext.args as
        --minimum_samples
      default: 1
  - minimum_proportion:
      type: numeric
      description: |
        A minimum proportion of observations that must pass the threshold.
        Supplied via task.ext.args as --minimum_proportion. Overrides
        minimum_samples
      default: 0
  - grouping_variable:
      type: optional string
      description: |
        Optionally supply a variable from the sample sheet that can be used to
        define groups and derive a minimum group size upon which to base
        minimum observation numbers. The rationale being to allow retention of
        features that might be present in only one group. Supplied via
        task.ext.args as --grouping_variable

  - meta:

      description: |
        Groovy Map containing information on experiment.
