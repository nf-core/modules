          Raw TSV or CSV format abundance matrix with features (e.g.
          genes) by row and observations (e.g. samples) by column. All rownames
          from the sample sheet should be present in the columns.

          Optional CSV or TSV format sample sheet with sample metadata. If
          provided this is used to infer minimum passing samples from group sizes
          present (see grouping_variable), but also to validate matrix columns.
          If not provided, all numeric columns are selected.
