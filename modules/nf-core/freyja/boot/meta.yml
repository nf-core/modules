description: Bootstrap sample demixing by resampling each site based on a multinomial
  distribution of read depth across all sites, where the event probabilities were
  determined by the fraction of the total sample reads found at each site, followed
  by a secondary resampling at each site according to a multinomial distribution (that
  is, binomial when there was only one SNV at a site), where event probabilities were
  determined by the frequencies of each base at the site, and the number of trials
  is given by the sequencing depth.
