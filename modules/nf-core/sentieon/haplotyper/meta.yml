        SentieonÂ® provides complete solutions for secondary DNA/RNA analysis for a variety of sequencing platforms, including short and long reads.
        Our software improves upon BWA, STAR, Minimap2, GATK, HaplotypeCaller, Mutect, and Mutect2 based pipelines and is deployable on any generic-CPU-based computing system.

  - emit_mode:
      type: string
      description: |
        Controls the output from the haplotyper.
        If emit_mode is set to "gvcf" then the haplotyper will only emit a gvcf.
        If emit_mode is set to "both" then it will emit both a vcf and a gvcf.
        Set to anything else, and it will only emit a vcf.
