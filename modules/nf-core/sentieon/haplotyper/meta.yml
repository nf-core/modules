        Controls the vcf output from the haplotyper.
        If emit_vcf is set to "all" then the haplotyper will output a vcf generated by the haplotyper in emit-mode "all".
        If emit_vcf is set to "confident" then the haplotyper will output a vcf generated by the haplotyper in emit-mode "confident".
        If emit_vcf is set to "variant" then the haplotyper will output a vcf generated by the haplotyper in emit_mode "confident".
