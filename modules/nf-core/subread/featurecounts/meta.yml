      description: featureCounts is a highly efficient general-purpose read summarization
        program that counts mapped reads for genomic features such as genes, exons,
        promoter, gene bodies, genomic bins and chromosomal locations. It can be used
        to count both RNA-seq and genomic DNA-seq reads.
