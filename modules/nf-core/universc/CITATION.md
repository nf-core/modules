        abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to quantify RNA molecules in individual cells has become popular owing to the large amount of information one can obtain from each experiment. We have developed UniverSC (https://github.com/minoda-lab/universc), a universal single-cell processing tool that supports any UMI-based platform. Our command-line tool enables consistent and comprehensive integration, comparison, and evaluation across data generated from a wide range of platforms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
