      2FAST2Q is ideal for CRISPRi-Seq, and for extracting and counting any kind of information from reads in the fastq format, such as barcodes in Bar-seq experiments.
      2FAST2Q can work with sequence mismatches, Phred-score, and be used to find and extract unknown sequences delimited by known sequences.
      2FAST2Q can extract multiple features per read using either fixed positions or delimiting search sequences.
