        CNVkit is a Python library and command-line software toolkit to infer and visualize copy number from high-throughput DNA sequencing data. It is designed for use with hybrid capture, including both whole-exome and custom target panels, and short-read sequencing platforms such as Illumina and Ion Torrent.
