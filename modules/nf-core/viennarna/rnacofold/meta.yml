        calculate secondary structures of two RNAs with dimerization

        The program works much like RNAfold, but allows one to specify two RNA
        sequences which are then allowed to form a dimer structure. RNA sequences
        are read from stdin in the usual format, i.e. each line of input
        corresponds to one sequence, except for lines starting with > which
        contain the name of the next sequence. To compute the hybrid structure
        of two molecules, the two sequences must be concatenated using the &
        character as separator. RNAcofold can compute minimum free energy (mfe)
        structures, as well as partition function (pf) and base pairing
        probability matrix (using the -p switch) Since dimer formation is
        concentration dependent, RNAcofold can be used to compute equilibrium
        concentrations for all five monomer and (homo/hetero)-dimer species,
        given input concentrations for the monomers. Output consists of the
        mfe structure in bracket notation as well as PostScript structure
        plots and “dot plot” files containing the pair probabilities, see
        the RNAfold man page for details. In the dot plots a cross marks
        the chain break between the two concatenated sequences. The program
        will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting of the
        single character @ or an end of file condition is encountered.
