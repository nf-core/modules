        Calculate minimum free energy secondary structures and partition function of RNAs

        The program reads RNA sequences, calculates their minimum free energy (mfe) structure and
        prints the mfe structure in bracket notation and its free energy. If not specified differently
        using commandline arguments, input is accepted from stdin or read from an input file, and
        output printed to stdout. If the -p option was given it also computes the partition function
        (pf) and base pairing probability matrix, and prints the free energy of the thermodynamic
        ensemble, the frequency of the mfe structure in the ensemble, and the ensemble diversity to stdout.
