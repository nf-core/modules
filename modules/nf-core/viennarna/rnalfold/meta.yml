        calculate locally stable secondary structures of RNAs

        Compute locally stable RNA secondary structure with a maximal base pair span.
        For a sequence of length n and a base pair span of L the algorithm uses only
        O(n+L*L) memory and O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is practical to “scan” very
        large genomes for short RNA structures. Output consists of a list of
        secondary structure components of size <= L, one entry per line. Each
        output line contains the predicted local structure its energy in
        kcal/mol and the starting position of the local structure.
