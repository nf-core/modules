          with one row per SNP, and a header including position for the physical position
          in 1 based coordinates, a0 for the reference allele, and a1 for the alternate

        type: file
        description: (Optional) File with positions of where to impute, lining up one-to-one
          with genfile. File is tab separated with no header, one row per SNP, with
          col 1 = chromosome, col 2 = physical position (sorted from smallest to largest),
          col 3 = reference base, col 4 = alternate base. Bases are capitalized.

    - phasefile:

        description: (Optional) File with truth phasing results. Supersedes genfile
          if both options given. File has a header row with a name for each sample,
          matching what is found in the bam file. Each subject is then a tab separated
          column, with 0 = ref and 1 = alt, separated by a vertical bar |, e.g. 0|0
          or 0|1. Note therefore this file has one more row than posfile which has no
          header.

        description: (Optional) Path to gen file with high coverage results.
          Empty for no genfile. If both genfile and phasefile are given, only phasefile
          is used, as genfile (unphased genotypes) is derivative to phasefile
          (phased genotypes). File has a header row with a name for each sample,
          matching what is found in the bam file. Each subject is then a tab seperated
          column, with 0 = hom ref, 1 = het, 2 = hom alt and NA indicating missing genotype,
          with rows corresponding to rows of the posfile.
          Note therefore this file has one more row than posfile which has no header [default \"\"]

          genetic map in cM. If no file included, rate is based on physical distance
          and expected rate (expRate).
