      type: map
      description: |
        Groovy Map containing contrast information, to be passed as reference
        and target levels, like '--reference_level $meta.reference
        --treatment_level $meta.target'
        e.g. [ variable:'treatment', reference:'treated', control:'saline', blocking:'' ]
  - meta2:
      type: map
      description: |
        Groovy Map containing information on experiment represented by max,
        features and samples, at a minimum an id.
        e.g. [ id:'test' ]
  - differential_results:
      type: list
      description: |

  - assay_file:
      type: list
      description: |
        CSV or TSV matrix file to use alongside differential statistics in
        interpretation. Usually a normalised form.
