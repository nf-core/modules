  - assay_files:
      type: list
      description: |
        List of TSV-format matrix files representing different measures for the same samples (e.g. raw and normalised).
  - contrasts:
      type: file
      description: |
        CSV-format file with four columns identifying the sample sheet variable, reference level, treatment level, and optionally a comma-separated list of covariates used as blocking factors.
