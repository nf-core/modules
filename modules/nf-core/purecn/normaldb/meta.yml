description: Build a normal database for coverage normalization from all the (GC-normalized)
  normal coverage files. N.B. as reported in
  https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/PureCN/inst/doc/Quick.html,
  it is advised to provide a normal panel (VCF format) to precompute mapping bias
  for faster runtimes.
