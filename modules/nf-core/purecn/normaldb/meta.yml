description: Build a normal database for coverage normalization from all the (GC-normalized) normal coverage files.
  N.B. as reported in https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/PureCN/inst/doc/Quick.html,
  it is advised to provide a normal panel (VCF format) to precompute mapping bias for faster runtimes.
