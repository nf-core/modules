  - significant:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Whether the pathway enrichment results should be restricted to significant ones (default: true); if false, all results will be returned
  - measure_underrepresentation:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Whether the genes should be tested for underrepresentation in pathways instead of for overrepresentation; default: false

      description: |
        Comma-separated list of data sources to search for pathways, e.g. 'GO,REAC'. Check https://rdrr.io/cran/gprofiler2/man/gost.html for a list of available sources

      type: file
      pattern: "*.{csv,tsv,txt}"
      description: |
        Path to a CSV/TSV/TXT file listing gene IDs that should be used as the background (will override count_file). This can be an expression matrix (see also background_column parameter); if so, will only consider those genes with an expression value > 0 in at least one sample. Alternatively, this can be a TXT file containing only a list of gene IDs.
  - background_column:
      type: string
