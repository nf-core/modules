        description: |
          Path to a CSV/TSV/TXT file listing gene IDs that should be used as the background (will override count_file). This can be an expression matrix (see also background_column parameter); if so, will only consider those genes with an expression value > 0 in at least one sample. Alternatively, this can be a TXT file containing only a list of gene IDs.
