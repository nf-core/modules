  - significant:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Whether the pathway enrichment results should be restricted to significant ones (default: true); if false, all results will be returned
  - measure_underrepresentation:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Whether the genes should be tested for underrepresentation in pathways instead of for overrepresentation; default: false
  - correction_method:
      type: string
      description: |
        Which method to use for multiple testing correction, one of "gSCS" (synonyms: "analytical", "g_SCS"), "fdr" (synonym: "false_discovery_rate"), "bonferroni"; default: "gSCS" 
      pattern: "gSCS|analytical|g_SCS|fdr|false_discovery_rate|bonferroni"
  - sources:
      type: string
      description: |
        Comma-separated list of data sources to search for pathways, e.g. 'GO,REAC'. Check https://rdrr.io/cran/gprofiler2/man/gost.html for a list of available sources
  - evcodes:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Whether to include evidence codes in the results, may decrease performance; default: false. Check https://rdrr.io/cran/gprofiler2/man/gost.html for more info

      description: |
        p value threshold for determining which results are significant; default: 0.05
  - gmt_file:
      type: file
      pattern: "*.{gmt}"
      description: |

  - background_file:
      type: file
      pattern: "*.{csv,tsv,txt}"
      description: |
        Path to a CSV/TSV/TXT file listing gene IDs that should be used as the background (will override count_file). This can be an expression matrix (see also background_column parameter); if so, will only consider those genes with an expression value > 0 in at least one sample. Alternatively, this can be a TXT file containing only a list of gene IDs.
  - background_column:
      type: string
      description: |
        Which column to use as gene ID info in the background_file if it is a matrix; if this is not set (and the file is a matrix), will use the first column as IDs
