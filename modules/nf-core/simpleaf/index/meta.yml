          FASTA file containing the genome sequence.
          It conflicts with transcript_fasta.
          When transcript_fasta is provided, it must be empty (provided as []).
          When transcript_fasta is empty, it must be provided together with its corresponding genome_gtf file.

          GTF file containing gene annotations.
          It conflicts with transcript_fasta.
