  - chemistry:
      type: string
      description: |
        Chemistry used for library preparation.  It can be a string describing
        the specific chemistry or the geometry of the barcode, UMI, and
        mappable read.  For example, "10xv2" and "10xv3" will apply the
        appropriate settings for 10x Chromium v2 and v3 protocols,
        respectively.  Alternatively, you can provide a general geometry string
        if your chemistry is not pre-registered.  For example, instead of
        "10xv2", you could use "1{b[16]u[10]x:}2{r:}", or instead of "10xv3",
        you could use "1{b[16]u[12]x:}2{r:}".
