      description: >
        ARACNe3 is an implementation of ARACNe which presents computational improvements
        and theoretical changes to the recent ARACNe-AP implementation. Given a list of
        regulators and a gene expression profile, ARACNe3 is used to infer irreducibly
        dependent regulatory interactions and output a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN).
        The mainstream analysis generates many GRNs of subsamples of the profile (called
        "subnetworks") and then consolidates the subnetworks into a robust GRN. The
        consolidated output is a GRN whose edge strengths can be quantified by several
        statistical metrics.
