description: SV callers like lumpy look at split-reads and pair distances to find
  structural variants. This tool is a fast way to add depth information to those calls.
  This can be used as additional information for filtering variants; for example we
  will be skeptical of deletion calls that do not have lower than average coverage
  compared to regions with similar gc-content.
