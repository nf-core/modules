description: Gubbins (Genealogies Unbiased By recomBinations In Nucleotide Sequences)
  is an algorithm that iteratively identifies loci containing elevated densities of
  base substitutions while concurrently constructing a phylogeny based on the putative
  point mutations outside of these regions.
