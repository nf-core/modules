  Haplocheck detects contamination patterns in mtDNA AND WGS sequencing studies by analyzing
  the mitochondrial DNA. Haplocheck also works as a proxy tool for nDNA studies and provides
  users a graphical report to investigate the contamination further. Internally, it uses the
  Haplogrep tool, that supports rCRS and RSRS mitochondrial versions.
