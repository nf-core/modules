        Entrez Direct (EDirect) is a method for accessing the NCBI's set of
        interconnected databases (publication, sequence, structure, gene,
        variation, expression, etc.) from a UNIX terminal window. Functions
        take search terms from command line arguments. Individual operations
        are combined to build multi-step queries. Record retrieval and
        formatting normally complete the process.
