[![Python package](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Python+package%22) [![Upload Python Package](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py/workflows/Upload%20Python%20Package/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Upload+Python+Package%22) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/rocrate.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/rocrate/) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/216605684.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/216605684)

ro-crate-py is a Python library to create and consume [Research Object Crates](https://w3id.org/ro/crate). It currently supports the [RO-Crate 1.1](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1) specification.

## Installation

ro-crate-py requires Python 3.9 or later. The easiest way to install is via [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/):

```
pip install rocrate
```

To install the package with support for converting Galaxy workflows to CWL:

```
pip install rocrate[ga2cwl]
```

To install manually from this code base (e.g., to try the latest development revision):

```
git clone https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py
cd ro-crate-py
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Creating an RO-Crate

In its simplest form, an RO-Crate is a directory tree with an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file at the top level. This file contains metadata about the other files and directories, represented by [data entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/data-entities.html). These metadata consist both of properties of the data entities themselves and of other, non-digital entities called [contextual entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/contextual-entities.html). A contextual entity can represent, for instance, a person, an organization or an event.

Suppose Alice and Bob worked on a research task together, which resulted in a manuscript written by both; additionally, Alice prepared a spreadsheet containing the experimental data, which Bob used to generate a diagram. We will create placeholder files for these documents:

```bash
mkdir exp
touch exp/paper.pdf
touch exp/results.csv
touch exp/diagram.svg
```

Let's make an RO-Crate to package all this:

```python
from rocrate.rocrate import ROCrate

crate = ROCrate()
paper = crate.add_file("exp/paper.pdf", properties={
    "name": "manuscript",
    "encodingFormat": "application/pdf"
})
table = crate.add_file("exp/results.csv", properties={
    "name": "experimental data",
    "encodingFormat": "text/csv"
})
diagram = crate.add_file("exp/diagram.svg", dest_path="images/figure.svg", properties={
    "name": "bar chart",
    "encodingFormat": "image/svg+xml"
})
```

The `dest_path` argument is used to specify the relative path of the file with respect to the crate's directory (which will be determined when the crate is written). Note that the first two `add_file` calls do not specify `dest_path`: in this case, it will be set to the source file's basename (`"paper.pdf"` in the first case), so the file will be at the crate's top level when it is written.

We've started by adding the data entities. Now we need contextual entities to represent Alice and Bob:

```python
from rocrate.model.person import Person

alice_id = "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000"
bob_id = "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001"
alice = crate.add(Person(crate, alice_id, properties={
    "name": "Alice Doe",
    "affiliation": "University of Flatland"
}))
bob = crate.add(Person(crate, bob_id, properties={
    "name": "Bob Doe",
    "affiliation": "University of Flatland"
}))
```

At this point, we have a representation of the various entities. Now we need to express the relationships between them. This is done by adding properties that reference other entities:

```python
paper["author"] = [alice, bob]
table["author"] = alice
diagram["author"] = bob
```

You can also add whole directories together with their contents. In an RO-Crate, a directory is represented by the `Dataset` entity. Create a directory with some placeholder files:

```bash
mkdir exp/logs
touch exp/logs/log1.txt
touch exp/logs/log2.txt
```

Now add it to the crate:

```python
logs = crate.add_dataset("exp/logs")
```

Finally, we serialize the crate to disk:

```python
crate.write("exp_crate")
```

Now the `exp_crate` directory should contain copies of all the files we added and an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file with a [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) representation of the entities and relationships we created, with the following layout:

```
exp_crate/
|-- images/
|   `-- figure.svg
|-- logs/
|   |-- log1.txt
|   `-- log2.txt
|-- paper.pdf
|-- results.csv
`-- ro-crate-metadata.json
```

Exploring the `exp_crate` directory, we see that all files and directories contained in `exp/logs` have been added recursively to the crate. However, in the `ro-crate-metadata.json` file, only the top level Dataset with `@id` `"exp/logs"` is listed. This is because we used `crate.add_dataset("exp/logs")` rather than adding every file individually. There is no requirement to represent every file and folder within the crate in the `ro-crate-metadata.json` file. If you do want to add files and directories recursively to the metadata, use `crate.add_tree` instead of `crate.add_dataset` (but note that it only works on local directory trees).

Some applications and services support RO-Crates stored as archives. To save the crate in zip format, use `write_zip`:

```python
crate.write_zip("exp_crate.zip")
```

#### Appending elements to property values

What ro-crate-py entities actually store is their JSON representation:

```python
paper.properties()
```

```json
{
  "@id": "paper.pdf",
  "@type": "File",
  "name": "manuscript",
  "encodingFormat": "application/pdf",
  "author": [
    {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000"},
    {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001"},
  ]
}
```

When `paper["author"]` is accessed, a new list containing the `alice` and `bob` entities is generated on the fly. For this reason, calling `append` on `paper["author"]` won't actually modify the `paper` entity in any way. To add an author, use the `append_to` method instead:

```python
donald = crate.add(Person(crate, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck", properties={
  "name": "Donald Duck"
}))
paper.append_to("author", donald)
```

Note that `append_to` also works if the property to be updated is missing or has only one value:

```python
for n in "Mickey_Mouse", "Scrooge_McDuck":
    p = crate.add(Person(crate, f"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{n}"))
    donald.append_to("follows", p)
```

#### Handling of special characters

Since RO-Crate entity identifiers are URIs (relative or absolute), special characters in them must be percent-encoded. When adding data entities from the local file system, this is handled automatically by the library:

```pycon
>>> crate = ROCrate()
>>> d = crate.add_dataset("read_crate/a b")
>>> d.id
'a%20b/'
>>> f = crate.add_file("read_crate/a b/c d.txt", dest_path="data/a b/c d.txt")
>>> f.id
'data/a%20b/c%20d.txt'
```

When adding an entity whose identifier is an absolute URI (see next section), on the other hand, the identifier provided by the user is expected to be a valid URI, in particular with any special characters in path components already percent-encoded.

#### Adding remote entities

Data entities can also be remote:

```python
input_data = crate.add_file("http://example.org/exp_data.zip")
```

By default the file won't be downloaded, and will be referenced by its URI in the serialized crate:

```json
{
  "@id": "http://example.org/exp_data.zip",
  "@type": "File"
},
```

If you add `fetch_remote=True` to the `add_file` call, however, the library (when `crate.write` is called) will try to download the file and include it in the output crate.

Another option that influences the behavior when dealing with remote entities is `validate_url`, also `False` by default: if it's set to `True`, when the crate is serialized, the library will try to open the URL to add / update metadata bits such as the content's length and format (but it won't try to download the file unless `fetch_remote` is also set).

#### Adding entities with an arbitrary type

An entity can be of any type listed in the [RO-Crate context](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/context.jsonld). However, only a few of them have a counterpart (e.g., `File`) in the library's class hierarchy (either because they are very common or because they are associated with specific functionality that can be conveniently embedded in the class implementation). In other cases, you can explicitly pass the type via the `properties` argument:

```python
from rocrate.model.contextentity import ContextEntity

hackathon = crate.add(ContextEntity(crate, "#bh2021", properties={
    "@type": "Hackathon",
    "name": "Biohackathon 2021",
    "location": "Barcelona, Spain",
    "startDate": "2021-11-08",
    "endDate": "2021-11-12"
}))
```

Note that entities can have multiple types, e.g.:

```python
    "@type" = ["File", "SoftwareSourceCode"]
```

### Consuming an RO-Crate

An existing RO-Crate package can be loaded from a directory or zip file:

```python
crate = ROCrate('exp_crate')  # or ROCrate('exp_crate.zip')
for e in crate.get_entities():
    print(e.id, e.type)
```

```
./ Dataset
ro-crate-metadata.json CreativeWork
paper.pdf File
results.csv File
images/figure.svg File
https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000 Person
https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001 Person
```

The first two entities shown in the output are the [root data entity](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/root-data-entity.html) and the [metadata file descriptor](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/metadata.html), respectively. The former represents the whole crate, while the latter represents the metadata file. These are special entities managed by the `ROCrate` object, and are always present. The other entities are the ones we added in the [section on RO-Crate creation](#creating-an-ro-crate).

As shown above, `get_entities` allows to iterate over all entities in the crate. You can also access only data entities with `crate.data_entities` and only contextual entities with `crate.contextual_entities`. For instance:

```python
for e in crate.data_entities:
    author = e.get("author")
    if not author:
        continue
    elif isinstance(author, list):
        print(e.id, [p["name"] for p in author])
    else:
        print(e.id, repr(author["name"]))
```

```
paper.pdf ['Alice Doe', 'Bob Doe']
results.csv 'Alice Doe'
images/figure.svg 'Bob Doe'
```

You can fetch an entity by its `@id` as follows:

```python
article = crate.dereference("paper.pdf")
```

## Advanced features

### Modifying the crate from JSON-LD dictionaries

The `add_jsonld` method allows to add a contextual entity directly from a
JSON-LD dictionary containing at least the `@id` and `@type` keys:

```python
crate.add_jsonld({
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000",
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Alice Doe"
})
```

Existing entities can be updated from JSON-LD dictionaries via `update_jsonld`:

```python
crate.update_jsonld({
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000",
    "name": "Alice K. Doe"
})
```

There is also an `add_or_update_jsonld` method that adds the entity if it's
not already in the crate and updates it if it already exists (note that, when
updating, the `@type` key is ignored). This allows to "patch" an RO-Crate from
a JSON-LD file. For instance, suppose you have the following `patch.json` file:

```json
{
    "@graph": [
        {
            "@id": "./",
            "author": {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001"}
        },
        {
            "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001",
            "@type": "Person",
            "name": "Bob Doe"
        }
    ]
}
```

Then the following sets Bob as the author of the crate according to the above
file:

```python
crate = ROCrate("temp-crate")
with open("patch.json") as f:
    json_data = json.load(f)
for d in json_data.get("@graph", []):
    crate.add_or_update_jsonld(d)
```

## Command Line Interface

`ro-crate-py` includes a hierarchical command line interface: the `rocrate` tool. `rocrate` is the top-level command, while specific functionalities are provided via sub-commands. Currently, the tool allows to initialize a directory tree as an RO-Crate (`rocrate init`) and to modify the metadata of an existing RO-Crate (`rocrate add`).

```console
$ rocrate --help
Usage: rocrate [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  add
  init
  write-zip
```

### Crate initialization

The `rocrate init` command explores a directory tree and generates an RO-Crate metadata file (`ro-crate-metadata.json`) listing all files and directories as `File` and `Dataset` entities, respectively.

```console
$ rocrate init --help
Usage: rocrate init [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --gen-preview         Generate a HTML preview file for the crate.
  -e, --exclude NAME    Exclude files or directories from the metadata file.
                        NAME may be a single name or a comma-separated list of
                        names.
  -c, --crate-dir PATH  The path to the root data entity of the crate.
                        Defaults to the current working directory.
  --help                Show this message and exit.
```

The command acts on the current directory, unless the `-c` option is specified. The metadata file is added (overwritten if present) to the directory at the top level, turning it into an RO-Crate.

### Adding items to the crate

The `rocrate add` command allows to add file, datasets (directories), workflows and other entity types (currently [testing-related metadata](https://crs4.github.io/life_monitor/workflow_testing_ro_crate)) to an RO-Crate:

```console
$ rocrate add --help
Usage: rocrate add [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  dataset
  file
  test-definition
  test-instance
  test-suite
  workflow
```

Note that data entities (e.g., workflows) must already be present in the directory tree: the effect of the command is to register them in the metadata file.

### Example

```bash
# From the ro-crate-py repository root
cd test/test-data/ro-crate-galaxy-sortchangecase
```

This directory is already an RO-Crate. Delete the metadata file to get a plain directory tree:

```bash
rm ro-crate-metadata.json
```

Now the directory tree contains several files and directories, including a Galaxy workflow and a Planemo test file, but it's not an RO-Crate since there is no metadata file. Initialize the crate:

```bash
rocrate init
```

This creates an `ro-crate-metadata.json` file that lists files and directories rooted at the current directory. Note that the Galaxy workflow is listed as a plain `File`:

```json
{
  "@id": "sort-and-change-case.ga",
  "@type": "File"
}
```

To register the workflow as a `ComputationalWorkflow`:

```bash
rocrate add workflow -l galaxy sort-and-change-case.ga
```

Now the workflow has a type of `["File", "SoftwareSourceCode", "ComputationalWorkflow"]` and points to a `ComputerLanguage` entity that represents the Galaxy workflow language. Also, the workflow is listed as the crate's `mainEntity` (this is required by the [Workflow RO-Crate profile](https://w3id.org/workflowhub/workflow-ro-crate/1.0), a subtype of RO-Crate which provides extra specifications for workflow metadata).

To add [workflow testing metadata](https://crs4.github.io/life_monitor/workflow_testing_ro_crate) to the crate:

```bash
rocrate add test-suite -i '#test1'
rocrate add test-instance '#test1' http://example.com -r jobs -i '#test1_1'
rocrate add test-definition '#test1' test/test1/sort-and-change-case-test.yml -e planemo -v '>=0.70'
```

To add files or directories after crate initialization:

```bash
cp ../sample_file.txt .
rocrate add file sample_file.txt -P name=sample -P description="Sample file"
cp -r ../test_add_dir .
rocrate add dataset test_add_dir
```

The above example also shows how to set arbitrary properties for the entity with `-P`. This is supported by most `rocrate add` subcommands.

```console
$ rocrate add workflow --help
Usage: rocrate add workflow [OPTIONS] PATH

Options:
  -l, --language [cwl|galaxy|knime|nextflow|snakemake|compss|autosubmit]
                                  The workflow language.
  -c, --crate-dir PATH            The path to the root data entity of the
                                  crate. Defaults to the current working
                                  directory.
  -P, --property KEY=VALUE        Add an additional property to the metadata
                                  for this entity. Can be used multiple times
                                  to set multiple properties.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```
