        This will create a GitHub repository for the pipeline.

        The repository will include:
        - Continuous Integration (CI) tests
        - Issues and pull requests templates

        The initialisation of a git repository is required to use the nf-core/tools.
        This means that even if you unselect this option, your pipeline will still contain a `.git` directory and `.gitignore` file.
