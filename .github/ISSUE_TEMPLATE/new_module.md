# nf-core/modules new module suggestion

Hi there!

Thanks for suggesting a new module for the modules!
Please delete this text and anything that's not relevant from the template below:

Replace TOOL with the bioconda name for the tool in the following text, so that the link is functional.

Replace TOOL/SUBTOOL in the issue title so that it's understandable.
-->

I think it would be good to have a module for [TOOL](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/TOOL/README.html)

- [ ] This module does not exist yet with the [`nf-core modules list`](https://github.com/nf-core/tools#list-modules) command
- [ ] There is no [open pull request](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/pulls) for this module
- [ ] There is no [open issue](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/issues) for this module
- [ ] If I'm planning to work on this module, I added myself to the `Assignees` to facilitate tracking who is working on the module
